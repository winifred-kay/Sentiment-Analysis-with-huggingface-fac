# Project : Natural Language Processing

##Introduction
 In recent years, the revolutionary advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have piqued interest in several industries, including healthcare. Combining the power of AI and natural language processing (NLP), This project aims to predict the sepsis status of patients using sentiment analysis. This innovative approach showcases the potential of technology to improve patient outcomes and revolutionize healthcare systems.

## Project Flow
###### Understanding Sepsis:
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by the body's response to an infection. It occurs when the immune system spirals out of control, causing widespread inflammation, organ dysfunction, and, if left untreated, can lead to severe complications or even death. The early detection of sepsis is crucial for prompt interventions and better patient outcomes.

###### Utilizing Sentiment Analysis:
This NLP project leverages sentiment analysis, a technique that extracts emotional context from textual data, to predict a patient's sepsis status. By analyzing patient reports and relevant data.

###### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

###### Model Training and Evaluation:




###### Prediction and Integration:


## Setup
Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root (`root :: repo_name> ...`)  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
